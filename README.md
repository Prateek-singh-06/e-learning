# React.js App with Node.js Backend

This is a simple web application built with React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The backend server is configured to use nodemon for automatic server restarts during development.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: npm comes bundled with Node.js, so no separate installation is required.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Prateek-singh-06/e-learning
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd e-learning

## Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
cd frontend
npm install

cd ../backend
npm install

## Running the Application
Frontend
To run the React.js frontend:
cd frontend
npm start

This will start the development server for the React.js app. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Backend
To run the Node.js backend with nodemon:

cd backend
npm run start
This will start the backend server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected in the backend code.
